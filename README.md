# ROS Workspace for Lab Exercises

Go to the [Read the Docs](https://enee467.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page to get started!

If you wish to have your own copy of this workspace on GitHub to save the work, create a new
repository on your GitHub account using this repository as a **template**. Otherwise you can directly
clone this repository and name the workspace folder with the group name.

Modify the `<workspace-name>` field and clone the repository to the `home` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENEE467/lab-workspace.git ~/<workspace name>
```

- [Lab 7](https://enee467.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Lab7.html)
- [Lab 8]()


# Lab 7
## REPORT:
### 1. Give the pose in World Coordinates of the camera as determined in the initial
calibration.
### 2. Compute and include in your report the square root of the sum of the squares of the
components of the quaternion. How close is it to one?
### 3. Give the sample mean and sample covariance of the errors in the calibration as
determined by the second set of data points.
### 4. Give your assessment of the quality of the calibration.
  a. How close to zero is the sample mean of the error? Note that a common test of
the size of a vector is its length (In mathematics, itâ€™s norm).
  b. Are the position measurements more reliable than the orientation
measurements?
